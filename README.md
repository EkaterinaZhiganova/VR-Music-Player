The music player was created as part of the UX design course. The buttons for this are taken from the asset store.
The main purpose of the player, apart from playing music, was its invisibility. 
I wanted to create something that would not interfere with the perception of VR reality, would have minimal distraction from those windows that I have open in VR. 
Therefore, the player has a small size and the ability to close the main window with the player's buttons when all functions are running and the music is playing. 
The player has the following functions: play, stop, fast forward and rewind, mute/return sound. 
When buttons are pressed, they are highlighted in blue for better understanding by the user whether the button was pressed. 
When the player clicks on the mute button, the icon changes for the user understands that he needs to click again to cancel mut√≠ng.
There is possibility to download music directly from the user's computer (functionality is not developed). 
The player only plays music with the .wav extension.
